# Hello-World
just getting started

I am made of rage and passion with a deep seated desire to learn more, I would like to think I am an odd ball in the programming world because I am a social butterfly, and generally Extroverted. I'm not saying anyone else isn't but the stories I've heard lead me to belive I can't be to far off.
